          # You need to create a PAT with `repo` scope and add it as a secret named GH_PAT
          # if you want to push to a separate homebrew tap repository.
          # For now, we'll assume GITHUB_TOKEN is enough if the tap is in the same repo (which it isn't).
          # So we need a PAT.
          # I'll add a comment about this.
