# 🌱 Sprout

**Git worktrees for humans who hate clutter.**

`sprout` is a tiny CLI tool that manages your Git worktrees so you don't have to. It keeps your project directories clean by tucking worktrees away in `~/.local/share/sprout` (or `~/.sprout`), and gives you a nice fuzzy-finder interface to jump between them.

Stop `cd ../../other-repo`ing like a caveman.

## 🚀 Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap m44rten1/sprout
brew install sprout
```

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/m44rten1/sprout@latest
```

## 🛠 Usage

### Shell Completion

Enable tab completion with one command:

```bash
sprout install-completion
```

This automatically detects your shell (zsh/bash/fish) and configures completion. Restart your terminal and you're done!

Once configured, you can tab-complete:

- `sprout add <TAB>` - Shows all available branches
- `sprout open <TAB>` - Shows branches with existing worktrees
- `sprout remove <TAB>` - Shows branches with existing worktrees

### Add a worktree

Want to work on a new feature? Just sprout it.

```bash
sprout add feat/amazing-stuff
```

This creates a fresh worktree for `feat/amazing-stuff` in your sprout directory and sets it up for you. No more messing with `git worktree add ../../my-messy-folder/branch-name`.

If you have a `.sprout.yml` file with `on_create` hooks, they'll run automatically after creating the worktree. Your editor opens immediately so you can start browsing code while hooks run in the terminal.

**Skip hooks:**

```bash
sprout add feat/amazing-stuff --no-hooks
```

Create the worktree without running hooks, even if `.sprout.yml` exists.

```bash
sprout add feat/amazing-stuff --no-open
```

Create the worktree without opening the editor (useful for automation).

### Open a worktree

Jump back into the zone.

```bash
sprout open
```

This pops up a fuzzy finder list of your active worktrees. Pick one, and boom, you're in your editor.

If you have a `.sprout.yml` file with `on_open` hooks, they'll run automatically after opening. This keeps your worktree fresh with type-checks, codegen, etc.

**Skip hooks when opening:**

```bash
sprout open --no-hooks
```

Open the worktree without running hooks, even if `.sprout.yml` exists.

### Remove a worktree

Done with that PR? Nuke it.

```bash
sprout remove
```

Select the worktree you want to delete, and it's gone. Safe and sound.

### List worktrees

See what you've got growing.

**List worktrees for current repository:**

```bash
sprout list
```

**List worktrees from all repositories:**

```bash
sprout list --all
```

The `--all` flag shows worktrees from all your sprout-managed repositories, grouped by project. Perfect for getting a bird's-eye view of all your active work.

Output includes:

- 📦 Repository names (bold) with full paths (dim)
- Branch names (green) with worktree paths (dim)
- **Git status indicators** showing the state of each worktree:
  - ✗ (red) Dirty - uncommitted changes
  - ↑ (yellow) Ahead - unpushed commits
  - ↓ (cyan) Behind - needs pull
  - ↕ (magenta) Unmerged - commits not in main/master
- Globally aligned columns for easy scanning

Clean worktrees show no indicators. Multiple indicators can appear together (e.g., ✗ ↕).

## 🪝 Project Hooks

Sprout supports project-specific hooks that automate setup and sync tasks. Perfect for ensuring your worktrees are always ready to work with.

📖 **[Read the full hooks documentation →](HOOKS.md)**

### Configuration

Create a `.sprout.yml` file in your repository root:

```yaml
hooks:
  on_create:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build
  on_open:
    - npm run lint:types
    - npm run generate
```

**Hook types:**

- **on_create**: Runs automatically when creating a new worktree (via `sprout add`)
- **on_open**: Runs automatically when opening a worktree (via `sprout open`)

### Security

Hooks can execute arbitrary commands, so **you must explicitly trust each repository** before hooks will run.

**Trust a repository:**

```bash
sprout trust
```

**Remove trust from a repository:**

```bash
sprout untrust
```

**View hook status:**

```bash
sprout hooks
```

### Example Workflows

**Create new worktree with automatic bootstrap:**

```bash
sprout add feat/new-feature
# Editor opens immediately
# Hooks run automatically in terminal: npm ci, npm run build
# You can browse code while dependencies install
```

**Create worktree without running hooks:**

```bash
sprout add feat/quick-fix --no-hooks
# Worktree created, no hooks run
```

**Open worktree:**

```bash
sprout open feat/bug-fix
# Editor opens, on_open hooks run automatically in terminal
# Type-check, codegen, etc. run while you browse code
```

**Open worktree without running hooks:**

```bash
sprout open feat/bug-fix --no-hooks
# Editor opens, no hooks run
```

## 🧠 Philosophy

Your main repo folder should be for your main repo. Not a graveyard of 50 abandoned feature branches.
`sprout` enforces a clean separation:

- **Repo**: Just the bare essentials (or your main branch).
- **Work**: Happens in a dedicated sprout directory (`~/.local/share/sprout`).

It's like `virtualenv` but for your entire codebase.

Sprout follows the XDG Base Directory specification, storing worktrees in `~/.local/share/sprout` by default (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/sprout` if that environment variable is set).

### Auto-Repair

Sprout automatically maintains worktree health by running `git worktree repair` before each command. This happens silently in the background, so you never have to worry about moved directories or stale metadata.

If you need to manually repair worktrees, you can run:

```bash
cd <repository> && git worktree repair
```

### Architecture

Sprout follows the **"Functional Core, Imperative Shell"** pattern, separating pure business logic from side effects. This makes the codebase highly testable and maintainable.

📖 **[Read the architecture guide →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**

Key features of the architecture:

- **Pure functions** for all business logic (easy to test, no mocks needed)
- **Effects interface** for explicit side effect management
- **Action/Plan pattern** for separating planning from execution
- **Dry-run mode** built into all commands (`--dry-run` flag)
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with fast, reliable tests
